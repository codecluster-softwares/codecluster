# TypeScript Guidelines

## Code Style

1. Write short concise if statements on single line when possible.
2. Avoid adding blank lines on both sides of single line code.
3. Use meaningful variable and function names.
4. Prefer const over let for immutable values.
5. Use TypeScript types and interfaces for better code documentation.
6. Write simple async arrow functions on single line when under 80 chars.
7. Avoid unnecessary intermediate variables when used only once.

## Test Description Style

1. Keep test descriptions concise and to the point.
2. Avoid unnecessary articles, adverbs, and auxiliary words.
3. Focus on clear meaning rather than perfect English grammar.
4. Minimize comments in test code - only add when test logic is obscure.
5. Add periods to all comments.
