# Comment Guidelines

## Documentation Guidelines

1. Prefer doc comments over inline comments in function bodies.
2. Write doc comments for all exported APIs.
3. Interface props don't need detailed doc comments.
4. Document function params and return values in detail.
5. Omit comment docs for self-explanatory props obvious from names.

## Comment Structure

1. First line should provide a brief summary.
2. Use ordered list for detailed desc when you have 3+ points.
3. Use paragraph format if ordered list has fewer than 3 points.
4. Use unordered lists only for simple true/false or binary desc.
5. Add paragraphs after ordered lists for more detailed explanations.
6. Include param desc with their types and purposes.
7. Document return values with their types and meanings.
