# Comment Guidelines

## Documentation Guidelines

1. Prefer documentation comments over inline comments within function bodies.
2. Write documentation comments for all exported APIs.
3. Interface properties don't require detailed documentation comments.
4. Document function parameters and return values in detail.
5. Omit comment docs for self-explanatory properties that are obvious from their names.

## Comment Structure

1. First line should provide a brief summary.
2. Follow with ordered list for detailed descriptions when you have three or more points.
3. Use paragraph format if ordered list has fewer than three points.
4. Use unordered lists only for simple true/false or binary descriptions.
5. Additional paragraphs can be added after ordered lists for more detailed explanations.
6. Include parameter descriptions with their types and purposes.
7. Document return values with their types and meanings.
