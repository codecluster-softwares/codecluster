# Styles Guidelines

## Common Styles File

1. `app/common.scss` contains theme variables and default element styles.
2. Define color theme variables for light and dark modes.
3. Apply theme to document root with system preference support.
4. Define default styles for common elements like buttons and inputs.
5. Create reusable utility classes to avoid style duplication.
6. Use SCSS variables for consistent color management.
7. Support both explicit theme selection and system preference.
8. Organize styles by theme context for maintainability.
